CASE Tool Assessment #2 Delivery Questionnaire - TA2 Collins

Introduction

The goal of this delivery questionnaire for CASE Tool Assessment #2 is to 
provide TA7 Provatek guidance on where to find inputs in the delivery, how to 
run the prototype tools, and how to interpret their results.  Please include 
this completed questionnaire with your Tool Assessment #2 delivery.

This questionnaire is organized with respect to the “CASE Tool Assessment #2 
Plan” document. Before answering each question, please review the corresponding 
step from the plan for further details. A short answer may suffice if it 
references specific sections and/or pages of documentation to provide further 
information.
