# Simple_UAV_Example

This is a copy of the "simple" UAV model developed by Collins Aerospace for the CASE program. This is an internal copy intended for Adventium reference and development, and not an official artifact for the CASE project. The official copy of this model is maintained by Collins in a separate github repository. We manually synchronize this copy with the Collins copy as needed.
